# [Project 1: Indian Rent Prediction](https://github.com/lanewhitmore/Rent_Prediction)
- Constructed an application that predicts rental prices in Indian cities in both Indian Rupee and USD.
- Deployed and compared multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective. 
- Built an ensemble method that predicts monthly rental prices with around a $100 mean absolute error (MAE). 
- [Built a client facing API using StreamLit.](https://lanewhitmore-rent-prediction-rent-app-eda---whitmore-vd5d0e.streamlit.app/)

# [Project 2: Naticus-Droid Malware Classification](https://github.com/lanewhitmore/NATICUSdroid-Malware-Machine-Learning-Classification)
- Constructed and compared multiple machine learning algorithms. 
- Tuned the algorithms based on the primary business objective, to classify as many Android Malware applications as possible.
- Built a Random Forest ensembl method that has 99.8% precision with 95% overall accuracy. 

# [Project 3: Earth Land Temperature Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/stephenkuc/ADS506_FinalProj)
- Crafted decomposition charts to identify the weather trends across the six continents. 
- Created a 75 year linear regression forecast that identified warming trends. 
- Forecasts pointed out Australian and Asian temperatures rising more rapidly than North America.
